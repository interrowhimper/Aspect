  <h1>ᏣᎳᎩ ᎦᏬᏂᎯᏍᏗ Root Suffix/Aspect Drill</h1>
  <p>Welcome! This drill is intended to help you work on identifying the root suffix group a verb belongs to.
    If a word has a non-final suffix characteristic of an aspect, you should <b>name that aspect</b>. If the word does <b>not</b> have
    an aspect affix, you should name the root suffix that is characteristic of the verb in the 3rd person (singular) present tense (for example,
    g, h, sg, or glottal stop), which is the kind of entry the CED uses to index verbs. Words with tones are from CherokeeDictionary.net and follow those 
    tone marking and orthography rules. In the case of classificatory verbs, the [category] is given in brackets. </p>
